# 516hackers / zphisher-commands

> **NOTICE — FOR EDUCATIONAL & AUTHORIZED SECURITY TESTING ONLY**

This repository contains metadata and notes related to *zphisher*-style phishing techniques and command references. **I will not provide operational instructions or tools that enable phishing, account compromise, or other illicit activity.** The content in this README is intended for **defensive, awareness, and authorized security-research** purposes only — for example, teaching how phishing works so organizations can defend against it, or documenting mock examples in a controlled lab environment.

## About this repository

This repo is a collection of references, explanatory notes, and safe documentation about phishing concepts and common patterns used by attackers. It is *not* an operational guide and does not contain exploit code, phishing pages, or step-by-step instructions to perform social-engineering attacks.

Use cases:

* Educational material for security awareness training.
* Reference for defenders and incident responders learning phishing indicators.
* Controlled, authorized penetration tests performed by certified professionals with written consent.

---

## Legal & Ethical Notice

* **Do not** use any information from this repository to attempt unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or data.
* Unauthorized phishing or account takeover is illegal and harms people. The repository owner and contributors **do not** condone or support malicious misuse.
* If you are a security professional performing tests, **obtain written permission** from the system owner and follow all applicable laws and organizational policies.

---

## What you will find here (safe, non-actionable)

* High-level explanations of phishing techniques and social-engineering principles.
* Defensive indicators and detection tips (what to look for in emails, URLs, and web forms).
* Example incident-response checklists and containment guidance (non-exploitative).
* Suggested training exercises and templates for awareness campaigns (simulated, non-malicious).
* Links to reputable external resources for learning ethical hacking and defensive security.

---

## What *will not* be provided

To avoid facilitating crime, this repository does not include:

* Phishing page templates or files.
* Scripts or commands that automate phishing, credential harvesting, or account takeover.
* Step-by-step operational playbooks for attacking systems.

If your intent is legitimate (e.g., building a defensive lab or documenting a lawful penetration test you performed), please open an issue describing your project and include proof of authorization; maintainers will review and can advise on appropriate, non-actionable documentation.

## Suggested structure for defensive documentation (template)

If you want to maintain an ethical, defensive repo, consider organizing content like this:

```
README.md                  # Overview, legal notice, intended use
docs/                      # Non-actionable educational articles
docs/indicators.md         # Phishing indicators and URL analysis tips
docs/response-playbook.md  # Containment and notification checklist
docs/training-exercises.md # Simulation scripts for awareness (non-malicious)
resources/                 # Links to vendor advisories, CVEs, and research
CONTRIBUTING.md            # Contribution rules emphasizing ethics
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md         # Community guidelines
LICENSE                   # Recommended: CC-BY-SA or similar for docs
```
